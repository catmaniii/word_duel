# ⚔️ WORD DUEL

**WORD DUEL** is a fast-paced, two-player word construction game. Battle against a friend (Player 1 Red vs Player 2 Blue) to see who can build the most words from a single source word!

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  **Start the Game**: One player enters a 6-12 letter word, or picks one from the random presets.
2.  **Construct Words**: Players take turns building new English words using *only* the letters available in the main source word.
3.  **Score Points**: Each valid word earns you points based on its length (1 letter = 1 point).
4.  **Win the Duel**: The player with the highest score at the end wins!

### 📜 Pro Rules
- **No Repeats**: You can't use the same word twice.
- **Strict Vocabulary**: Proper nouns (names/places) and abbreviations are not allowed.
- **Magic Reveal**: Stuck on the source word? Click/Hold the source word to reveal its Chinese definition for inspiration!
